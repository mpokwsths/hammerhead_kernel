	  Say 'Y' here to enable reporting of cache and TLB errors to the kernel
	  log. Enabling this feature can be used as a system debugging technique
	  if cache corruption is suspected. Cache error statistics will also be
	  reported in /proc/cpu/msm_cache_erp.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_ERR_PANIC
	bool "Panic on L1 cache errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  To cause the kernel to panic whenever an L1 cache error is detected, say
	  'Y' here. This may be useful as a debugging technique if general system
	  instability is suspected.

	  For production builds, you should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_RECOV_ERR_PANIC
	bool "Panic on recoverable L1 cache errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP && MSM_L1_ERR_PANIC
	help
	  Certain CPU designs may be able to automatically recover from certain
	  kinds of L1 cache errors, even though the L1 cache itself may not
	  support error correction. These errors should not result in any kind
	  of corruption, but their presence is nevertheless an indication of
	  poor system health. To cause the kernel to panic whenever a
	  recoverable L1 cache error is detected, say 'Y' here. This may be
	  useful as a debugging technique if general system instability is
	  suspected.

	  For production builds, you should definitely say 'N' here.

config MSM_L1_ERR_LOG
	bool "Log CPU ERP events to system memory"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable logging CPU ERP events to an area of memory that will be
	  preserved across a system reset. This may be useful for detecting and
	  troubleshooting ERP-related system crashes in the field.

	  For production builds, you may want to say 'Y' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_PRINT_ACCESS_ERRORS
	bool "Report L2 master port slave/decode errors in kernel log"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Master port errors can occur when a memory request is not properly
	  handled by the destination slave. This can occur if the destination
	  register does not exist or is inaccessible due to security
	  restrictions or (in some cases) clock configuration. Enabling this
	  option will cause a backtrace to be printed to the kernel log whenever
	  such an error is encountered. Note that the error is reported as an
	  interrupt rather than as an exception, meaning that the backtrace may
	  have some skid. This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_PORT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on L2 master port errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP && MSM_L2_ERP_PRINT_ACCESS_ERRORS
	help
	  Master port errors can occur when a memory request is not properly
	  handled by the destination slave. Enable this option to catch drivers
	  which attempt to access bad areas of the address space, or access
	  hardware registers in an improper state (such as certain clocks not
	  being on). This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_1BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on recoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a single-bit (correctable) soft error. This option should
	  only be enabled when doing low-level debugging where cache corruption
	  is suspected.

	  For production builds, you should definitely say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_2BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on unrecoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a double-bit (non-correctable) soft error. Debug builds
	  will likely benefit from having this option enabled to catch cache
	  problems as soon as possible.

	  For production builds, it may be acceptable to say 'N' here, since
	  an uncorrectable error might not necessarily cause further problems.

config MSM_DCVS
	bool "Use MSM DCVS for CPU/GPU Frequency control"
	depends on MSM_SCM
	help
	  Enable support for MSM DCVS to control all CPU and GPU core frequencies.
	  The DCVS manager allows idle driver to feed the idle information to the
	  algorithm and the algorithm returns a frequency for the core which is
	  passed to the frequency change driver.

config MSM_HOTPLUG

	help
	  The MSM hotplug driver controls on-/offlining of additional cores based
	  on current cpu load.

config MSM_CPR

config HAVE_ARCH_HAS_CURRENT_TIMER
	bool

config MSM_CACHE_DUMP
	bool "Cache dumping support"
	help
	  Add infrastructure to dump the L1 and L2 caches to an allocated buffer.
	  This allows for analysis of the caches in case cache corruption is
	  suspected.

config MSM_CACHE_DUMP_ON_PANIC
	bool "Dump caches on panic"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_DUMP
	help
	  By default, the caches are flushed on panic. This means that trying to
	  look at them in a RAM dump will give useless data. Select this if you
	  want to dump the L1 and L2 caches on panic before any flush occurs.
	  If unsure, say N

config MSM_HSIC_SYSMON
	tristate "MSM HSIC system monitor driver"
	depends on USB
	help
	  Add support for bridging with the system monitor interface of MDM

config MSM_HSIC_SYSMON_TEST
	tristate "MSM HSIC system monitor bridge test"
	depends on USB && MSM_HSIC_SYSMON && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Enable the test hook for the Qualcomm system monitor HSIC driver.
	  This will create a debugfs file entry named "hsic_sysmon_test" which
	  can be read and written to send character data to the sysmon port of
	  the modem over USB.

config MSM_RPC_PMIC
	tristate "MSM RPC PMIC driver"
	depends on MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	help
	 This driver supports the PMIC functionality over RPC for those MSM's

	 to the PMIC.

config MSM_RPC_PMAPP

	depends on MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	help
	 This driver supports the configuration of various PMIC APP modules
	 such as display backlight, vreg pin-ctrl, smps clock over the RPC
	 interface. This support is required for MSMs on which the APPS
	 does not have a direct access to the PMIC.

config MSM_ENABLE_WDOG_DEBUG_CONTROL
	bool "Enable control of watchdog debug and boot partition select"
	help
	  Enables support for controlling watchdog debug and boot partition
	  select. This is currently used to bypass debug image for PS_HOLD reset
	  by disabling watchdog debug and boot partition select. This allows
	  for a clean MSM reset for reboot scenarios.

config MSM_UARTDM_Core_v14

	help
	  Compile in RBCPR (RapidBridge Core Power Reduction) driver to support
	  corner vote for APC power rail. The driver takes PTE process voltage
	  suggestions in efuse as initial settings. It converts corner vote

config KRAIT_REGULATOR
	bool "Support Kraits powered via ganged regulators in the pmic"
	help
	 Certain MSMs have the Krait CPUs powered via a single supply
